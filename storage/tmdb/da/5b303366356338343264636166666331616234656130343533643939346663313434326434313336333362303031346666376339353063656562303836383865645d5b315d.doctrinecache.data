Luckily this one is not one of those. This was really a very enjoyable movie and I liked this movie a lot better than the first Thor movie which I felt was mostly silly.\r\n\r\nThis one has a story which was rather okay and held somewhat together. You have to remember that this is a comic book hero and the story is on that level of course. The special effects and the scenery is really nice as well. The views of Asgard is cool, almost breathtaking.\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins was excellent as Odin or Oden has he is called in Sweden, my country of birth. Tom Hiddleston is also very good in his role although I have to say that I really do not like his role but then he is supposed to be one of the bad guys so… Chris Hemsworth is good enough in his role but I would say that he is really the weakest ones in terms of acting.\r\n\r\nThe movie is liberally sprinkled with jokes as well and, thankfully, most of them are not too bad. Although a bit silly I have to say that I did laugh when Thor politely hung Mjölnir on the clothes rack in the apartment with Darcy and Dr. Selvig.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoyed this movie tremendously.","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5337c1079251417d9e00220d"},{"id":"545fe448c3a36853580095f9","author":"Andres Gomez","content":"More of the same. Predecible non elaborated script and with a total lack of sense of humor.\r\n\r\nThe FX are, again, OK, but the feeling of swords, axes, armors and helmets is of cheap plastic.","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/545fe448c3a36853580095f9"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}";
