Ocean traffic grinds to a standstill as everyone lives in fear of the insatiable beast. Out of options, the US government unleashes the top secret Mecha Shark project -- a mechanical shark built to have the same exact characteristics as Mega. A pair of scientists pilot the mechanical creature as they fight Mega in a pitched battle to save the planet. But when faulty mechanics cause the Mecha to go after humans, the scientists must somehow guide Mega to Mecha in hopes that the two titans will kill each other - or risk untold worldwide destruction.","popularity":0.322512,"poster_path":"/aD8VXYRfwJbeXOBRhuZR2PJ2FHC.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Asylum, The","id":3991}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Monster vs Metal","title":"Mega Shark vs. Mecha Shark","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":7}";
