But it is the right thing since the Rocky Balboa is getting old. Besides, in this reboot era, keeping franchise alive and leaping into the next generation was a very smart move. By doing this, they're keeping the original series fans with them to back it. I hope this will only get going like the Bond movies, since the young star, Jordan has another 30+ year potential to continue the 'Rocky' legacy by delivering some hits in his belt.\r\n\r\nI don't know how they have done it, just kept everything so simple yet delivered a successful movie. The director of 'Fruitvale Station' and its actor Jordan's second successive run. I wish the combo return for the third time for another grand scale flick. Of course Stallone's presence made a big difference, but the way his character was portrayed, I feel the next film will get more emotional, especially between Rocky and Adonis like Rocky and Micky. And I'm also hoping for a bit better romantic tale on the side.\r\n\r\nI grew up watching 'Rocky' movies, so I wanted badly it to be at least a decent, but it is a fantastic flick and I definitely suggest for those people like me. The youngsters as well can taste the new beginning in the Rocky legacy. CREED is the new ROCKY. The blueprint for the screenplay was exactly same as the original movies, even the music was very comparable yet everything was updated to the current timeline. Now I'm looking for a follow-up in the next 3 years.\r\n\r\n8/10","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/56cdebf5c3a368127f0000fb"},{"id":"56e25218c3a368700b0015ec","author":"mfProg","content":"Так себе. Местами пафос просто прет наружу - даже противно смотреть. Сюжет вытянет из пальца, особенно не понравилось наличие больных в фильме: девушка музыкант, теряющая слух и рокки у которого находят рак. Если бы не фильмы про рокки, то я в принципе сомневаюсь, что фильм бы заметили.","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/56e25218c3a368700b0015ec"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3}";
