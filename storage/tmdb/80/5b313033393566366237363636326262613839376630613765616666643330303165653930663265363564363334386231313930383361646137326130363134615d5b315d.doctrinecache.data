The answer lies up in the stratosphere, where cloud people sculpt babies from clouds and bring them to life. Gus, a lonely and insecure grey cloud, is a master at creating \"dangerous\" babies. Crocodiles, porcupines, rams and more - Gus's beloved creations are works of art, but more than a handful for his loyal delivery stork partner, Peck. As Gus's creations become more and more rambunctious, Peck's job gets harder and harder. How will Peck manage to handle both his hazardous cargo and his friend's fiery temperament?","popularity":0.805548,"poster_path":"/5M5bg79OV96Vb4O0fDjX5clxASG.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Pixar Animation Studios","id":3}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Charming and cute and clever","title":"Partly Cloudy","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":178}";
