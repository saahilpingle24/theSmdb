Laing quickly settles into high society life and meets the buildingâ€™s eccentric tenants: Charlotte (Miller), his upstairs neighbor and bohemian single mother; Wilder (Evans), a charismatic documentarian who lives with his pregnant wife Helen (Moss); and Mr. Royal (Irons), the enigmatic architect who designed the building. Life seems like paradise to the solitude-seeking Laing. But as power outages become more frequent and building flaws emerge, particularly on the lower floors, the regimented social strata begins to crumble and the building becomes a battlefield in a literal class war.","popularity":4.339385,"poster_path":"/grgPRTKTnm7ktOiSSNFcutiv0vS.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Ingenious Media","id":290},{"name":"HanWay Films","id":2395},{"name":"Scope Pictures","id":11199},{"name":"Recorded Picture Company (RPC)","id":11561},{"name":"Northern Ireland Screen","id":11667}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leave the real world behind","title":"High-Rise","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":47}";
