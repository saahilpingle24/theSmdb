With Veil, it begins 30 years ago, when members of a religious cult known as Heaven's Veil take their own lives. The truth behind what really happened remains buried deep in the memory of the sole survivor, a five-year-old girl, who returns to the compound with a documentary crew as an adult. They soon discover something that is far more terrifying than anything they could have imagined.","popularity":2.164695,"poster_path":"/kdm4LBCphAzvr2XbGi6eRJNXeXE.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Blumhouse Productions","id":3172}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The dead come back","title":"The Veil","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":32}";
