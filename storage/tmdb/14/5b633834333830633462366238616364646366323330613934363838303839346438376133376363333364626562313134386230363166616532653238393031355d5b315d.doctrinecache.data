Experiencing an overnight spike in popularity by the late 90s - a result of information appearing on the internet - the sport became inundated with thrill-seekers of all backgrounds and skill levels. Facing a new era of off-the-couch recreationalists, three influential participants, a canyoneering instructor, pioneer, and guidebook author each respond to a growing interest in the incredibly dangerous activity. Gorging employs the story of canyoneering to examine larger questions about the pursuit of thrills and the consequences that follow.","release_date":"2013-06-20","poster_path":"/sSrhWr4h2HyNqbw0aNxjHrscKp5.jpg","popularity":1.002465,"title":"Gorging","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/6kVVfNT0auG6fU5SFQ1zbayNWUC.jpg","genre_ids":[28,53,878],"id":7191,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Cloverfield","overview":"Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city.
